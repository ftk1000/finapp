[5/27/2020 Reuters: U.S. mortgage applications rise for sixth straight week](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-housing-idUSKBN2331IX)<br>

    U.S. applications for home mortgages jumped last week, in a sixth straight weekly increase, 
    suggesting the housing market could lead the economy’s recovery from the novel coronavirus crisis 
    even as high unemployment is expected to linger.

    The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted Purchase Index 
    increased 8.6% from a week earlier. On an unadjusted basis, the index rose 7.4% from the prior week 
    and was 9% higher compared to the same week a year ago. It was the sixth consecutive weekly gain 
    and a 54% surge since early April.
