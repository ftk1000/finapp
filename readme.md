[5/27/2020 Reuters: U.S. mortgage applications rise for sixth straight week](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-housing-idUSKBN2331IX)<br>

    U.S. applications for home mortgages jumped last week, in a sixth straight weekly increase, 
    suggesting the housing market could lead the economyâ€™s recovery from the novel coronavirus crisis 
    even as high unemployment is expected to linger.

    The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted Purchase Index 
    increased 8.6% from a week earlier. On an unadjusted basis, the index rose 7.4% from the prior week 
    and was 9% higher compared to the same week a year ago. It was the sixth consecutive weekly gain 
    and a 54% surge since early April.
